# Pathfinding-Visualizer

### Abstract

Pathfinding algorithms find their application in several domains such as google maps, satellite navigation systems and outing packets over the internet. Pathfinding algorithms require a search technique to get the fastest route, efficient, and shortest time. This paper presents a comparative analysis of some of the most popular path finding algorithms such as DFS, BFS, A* and Dijkstra. These algorithms were implemented and visualized in python to find the shortest path between the starting and ending point of a maze consisting of obstacles. Two maze generation algorithms- Recursive division and DFS maze were used to generate the maze and these two algorithms have also been highlighted in this paper. This paper describes the working of the path finding algorithms and subsequently attempts to compare the efficiency of the four algorithms based on metrics such as time taken, number of cells considered, cost of path and reachability. The comparative analysis showed that the A* algorithm was the most reliable of all four algorithms.
